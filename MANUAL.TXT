OUT OF CASH
(Sin Blanca)
------------

Your favorite rock band is coming to town, but you don't have enough money to buy a ticket.
You'll need to get the money, but not having good califications at school won't help you much in achieving your goal.

When hard work and "studying hard" are already out of your plan, all that's left is to use deception, cunning and cheek to achieve your dream.

Will you be able to do it?

Out of Cash (Sin Blanca) is a point and click graphic adventure in a comedy tone set in the first grades of high school of the 90s and full of cultural references of the time.
