# TO-DO

- [ ] Sound effects
- [ ] Don't use ints (32 bits). Use uint16_t or int16_t instead
- [ ] Bug: continue actual sentence say when load savegame (I'm not sure because the new talk system)
- [ ] Spanish characters on system font
- [ ] Custom fonts
- [ ] Iterate On-screen debug system (multiple vars)
- [ ] Music smooth transition (music fades and screen fades?)
- [ ] Headers reestructuration (prevent circular includes) and improve engine structure
- [ ] Real A* Pathfinding?
- [ ] Room definition/script tool
- [ ] Temporaly using roomScript as inventory script too. Rename roomScript a script or
multiple scripts?
- [ ] Separate renderer
- [ ] Hud structure doesn't need BITMAP array of selected verbs images. Could use the
internal grabber number def (same for gui)
- [ ] BUG: player walks slow on game start?
- [ ] Separate gui on header / .c?
